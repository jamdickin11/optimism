The Gateway Interface (also known as the ‘Bridge Front-End’) is available<!-- --> <a href="https://app.optimism.io/bridge/" target="_blank">here</a>. Depending on how you use the Gateway Interface, (i) these messages may be sent directly to Ethereum, OP Mainnet or other public blockchains or routed through various third-party interfaces and decentralized applications, and (ii) the bridging smart contracts with which you interact may be inherent to Ethereum, OP Mainnet, or other public blockchains themselves, or independently developed and deployed by various third parties (“Third-Party Bridges”).</li><li><b>Optimist NFTs, PFPs and AttestationStation:</b> The ability, if you are eligible, to connect your compatible Web3 Wallet to OP Mainnet and mint non-fungible tokens (“Optimist NFTs”) with customized profile pictures (“PFPs”) and interact with certain related smart contracts deployed on OP Mainnet (collectively, the “Optimist NFT Service”). When you mint an Optimist NFT, your Optimist NFT will be permanently linked to your wallet address and will not be transferable, and other users will be able to use the attestation smart contract deployed on OP Mainnet known as the “AttestationStation” (which you can read more about here) to post permanent, publicly available attestations about, among other things, your Optimist NFT. When you or others submit information or attestations in minting an Optimist NFT or using the AttestationStation, you and they are interacting directly with OP Mainnet and smart contracts deployed on OP Mainnet and entering that information into an on-chain permanent repository, where it will be publicly accessible and cannot be deleted.</li></ol><p><b>For clarity, the Foundation does not own or control, and the Services do not include, (i) OP Mainnet, which is public, permissionless, and runs on open-source self-executing smart contracts, (ii) any Other OP Chain/Fork, (iii) the Optimism Collective, or (iv) any Web3 Wallet.<!-- --> </b></p><p>The Foundation reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue any Service (in whole or in part) without notice to you.

Legal Compliance</h3><p>You will comply with all Laws that apply to you, your access to and use of the Services, and your actions and omissions that relate to the Services. If your access to or use of any Service (whether generally or for a particular purpose) is prohibited by any Law, then you are not authorized to access or use that Service (generally or for the particular purpose, as applicable). We are not responsible for your accessing or using the Services, including in any way that breaks any Law.</p><p>Without limiting the foregoing, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you are not, and for the duration of the time you use the Services, will not be: (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties (including but not limited to the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, His Majesty’s Treasury, and U.S. Department of Treasury), or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United Nations, European Union, any EU country, UK Treasury, or the United States. If at any point the above is no longer true, you must immediately cease using the Services.</p><h3 class="h7-min h6-max mt-6 mb-4">7. Assumption of Risk</h3><p>By using the Services, you (a) represent that you are sophisticated enough to understand the various inherent risks of using cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, including but not limited to the Gateway Interface, OP Mainnet, Other OP Chains/Forks, and digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other digital tokens such as those following the ERC-20 Ethereum token standard, and (b) acknowledge and accept all such risks, and acknowledge and agree that we make no representations or warranties (expressly or implicitly) regarding, and that you will not seek to hold us liable for, those risks, any or all of which could lead to losses and damages, including the total and irrevocable loss of your assets. Such risks include, but are not limited to, for example:</p><ul><li><b>Experimental nature.</b> The Services are experimental in nature. They represent an example reference implementation only. The Services are not intended to be used as a primary means of accessing or interacting with OP Mainnet.</li><li><b>Wallet security and safekeeping.</b> You are solely responsible for the safeguarding and security of your Web3 Wallets. If you lose your wallet seed phrase, private keys, or password, you may be forever unable to access your digital assets. Any unauthorized access to your wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of your digital assets. We have no involvement in, or responsibility for, storing, retaining, securing, or recovering your Web3 Wallet seed phrases, private keys, passwords, or digital assets, or for any unauthorized access to your Web3 Wallet.</li><li><b>Blockchain technology.</b> Public blockchains, and the technology underlying and interacting with cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, are experimental, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to a particular public blockchain (e.g., via forks) could disrupt these technologies irreparably. There is no guarantee that any of these technologies will not become unavailable, degraded, or subject to hardware or software errors, operational or technical difficulties, denial-of-service attacks, other cyberattacks, or other problems requiring maintenance, interruptions, delays, or errors.</li><li><b>Network cost and performance.</b> The cost, speed, and availability of transacting on public blockchain systems are subject to significant variability. There is no guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or transferred successfully or in a timely manner.</li><li><b>Blockchain transactions and smart contract execution.</b> <!-- -->Public blockchain-based transactions (including but not limited to transactions automatically executed by smart contracts) are generally considered irreversible when confirmed. Any transaction that will interact with smart contracts or be recorded on a public blockchain must be recorded with extreme caution.</li><li><b>Digital assets.</b> You own and control the digital assets held in and bridged via your Web3 Wallet. You bear all risk of loss of and relating to such digital assets, including but not limited to fluctuations in value. The markets for digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to various risk factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. Digital assets and their underlying blockchain networks are complex emerging technologies that may be subject to delays or halts, or go offline, as a result of errors, forks, attacks or other unforeseeable reasons. Anyone can create a digital asset, including fake versions of existing digital assets and digital assets that falsely claim to represent projects. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs. You are solely responsible for understanding the risks specific to each digital asset that is relevant to you.</li><li><b>Bridging.</b> In addition to being an especially novel and untested implementation of blockchain technology in general, cross-blockchain bridging technology has historically been, and may in the future be, the subject of numerous cyberattacks and exploits, including without limitation, hacks that exploit a vulnerability in the associated software, hardware, systems or other equipment or social engineering to gain control of the any bridge components, wallets, smart contracts or other related systems.<!-- --> </li><li><b>Control.</b> OP Mainnet, the OP Stack, and potentially, certain Other OP Chains/Forks are subject to periodic upgrades based on votes by the Optimism Collective. Although the Foundation stewards and administers certain governance processes of the Optimism Collective, it does not control the Optimism Collective or the outcomes of governance votes. The Optimism Collective may vote to implement, or fail to implement, a protocol upgrade that significantly impacts OP Mainnet, the OP Stack, and/or certain Other OP Chains/Forks, or introduces other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattack vectors, or other changes to OP Mainnet, the OP Stack, and/or certain Other OP Chains/Forks that could disrupt the operation of the Services, your ability to access your digital assets, or otherwise cause you damage or loss.</li><li><b>Third Party Risks.</b> Third-party products and services carry their own individual, oftentimes highly significant risks. When you use the Services to interact with any third-party product or service, you are subject to, and assume, all of those risks.</li><li><b>Tax and compliance.</b> Digital assets may be subject to taxation. It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct in connection with your use of the Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.</li><li><b>Legislative and regulatory risks.</b> Digital assets, blockchain technology, and any related software and services are subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and other jurisdictions throughout the world. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the usage, transferability, transactability and accessibility of the Services, OP Mainnet, Other OP Chains/Forks, or digital assets in general.</li></ul><p>You represent that you understand, and you agree to accept full responsibility for, all the risks of using any Service, the OP Stack, OP Mainnet, and any Other OP Chain/Fork, including, but not limited to, those listed above.</p><h3 class="h7-min h6-max mt-6 mb-4">8.

Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h3><p><b>Please carefully read the following arbitration agreement (this “<u>Arbitration Agreement</u>”). It requires you to arbitrate disputes with the Foundation and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</b></p><ol><li><b>Applicability of this Arbitration Agreement.</b> You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to the Terms or to any aspect of your relationship with the Foundation will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify, and (ii) you or the Foundation may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of the Terms or any prior version of the Terms.</li><li><b>Arbitration rules and forum.</b> To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to<!-- --> <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#afc3cac8cec3efc0dfdbc6c2c6dcc281c6c090dcdacdc5caccdb92fdca95e0dfdbc6c2c6dcc28ffbcaddc2dc"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="87ebe2e0e6ebc7e8f7f3eeeaeef4eaa9eee8">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at<!-- --> <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at<!-- --> <a href="index.html" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a> <!-- -->or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, the arbitrator may require the Foundation to pay the additional cost. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and applicable Law provide otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, the Foundation will pay the remaining filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. For claims above $75,000, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS rules. The arbitration rules permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The arbitrator or JAMS may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper. The parties agree that JAMS has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMS’s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, or a court of competent jurisdiction.</li><li><b>Authority of arbitrator.</b> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, provided that the arbitrator shall also be empowered to consolidate claims raised between the same parties to a single arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.</li><li><b>Waiver of jury trial.</b> YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 16(a) (Applicability of this Arbitration Agreement) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Arbitration Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</li><li><b>Waiver of class or other non-individualized relief.</b> ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the courts of the Cayman Island.
