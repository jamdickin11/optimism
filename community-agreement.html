Please read this entire Agreement and the Terms of Service carefully.</b><h3 class="h7-min h6-max mt-6 mb-4">1. OP MAINNET, OTHER OP CHAINS/FORKS, THE OP STACK, THE OPTIMISM COLLECTIVE, AND THE OPTIMISM FOUNDATION</h3><p>OP Mainnet is a public, internet-based blockchain computing platform. It is configured to inherit permissionless-ness, decentralization, and security attributes from another blockchain computing platform, Ethereum. Because of this configuration, OP Mainnet is referred to as a “Layer 2” blockchain computing platform.</p><p>OP Mainnet and the suite of open source code (including the OP Stack), tooling, infrastructure, and governance systems underlying it are composed of many different and evolving components, which are contributed, used, and supported by a wide variety of participants. These participants, ranging from developers to node operators, creators to token holders, and builders to web3 enthusiasts and beyond, comprise the Optimism community (the “Optimism Collective”). Other OP Chains/Forks may incorporate the OP Stack to varying degrees, and may or may not share the properties of OP Mainnet to varying degrees.</p><p>OP Mainnet, Other OP Chains/Forks that join the Superchain, and the OP Stack grow and change through the efforts of the Optimism Collective. The Optimism Collective is represented by a bicameral community organization, jointly governed by holders of the ‘OP’ token and Optimism citizens, and stewarded by the Foundation.</p><p>The Foundation currently contributes to the Optimism Collective. Among other things, the Foundation contributes to the continuing development and maintenance of OP Mainnet, certain Other OP Chains/Forks, and the OP Stack by making, maintaining, facilitating, publicizing or otherwise working on or encouraging:</p><ul><li>Community education and involvement.</li><li>Procedural and administrative support of Optimism Collective governance.</li><li>Allocations and delivery of community grants.</li><li>The <a href="index.html">Optimism.io</a> website.</li><li>The OP Stack and other software, smart contracts, APIs, and utilities, including the Gateway Interface and AttestationStation front ends that interact with OP Mainnet and/or certain Other OP Chains/Forks smart contracts.</li><li>Data processing for the network and operating one or more nodes.</li><li>Written, video, and other content on our website, various social media platforms and elsewhere.</li><li>Generally being a resource to the community in a variety of other ways.</li></ul><p>All of the above software, content and activities are referred to in this notice as our <b>“Software, Content, and Activities.”</b> <!-- -->Sometimes we are paid in connection with our Software, Content, and Activities. Other times we are not. We are a foundation company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands.</p><h3 class="h7-min h6-max mt-6 mb-4">2. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND RISKS</h3><p>When interacting with OP Mainnet, an Other OP Chain/Fork, the OP Stack or our Software, Content, and Activities, please keep the following points in mind:</p><ul><li><b>We do not control OP Mainnet or any Other OP Chain/Fork.</b> OP Mainnet and Other OP Chain/Forks (generally) are Ethereum Layer 2s, meaning that the canonical state of its blockchain can, at any time, be derived (by anyone) from information embedded in existing blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, the latest governance-approved version of the OP Stack and the OP Mainnet protocol can only be validly upgraded through governance decisions by the Optimism Collective. We do not control Ethereum or the Optimism Collective, and you should not rely on us (or any other party) to control OP Mainnet or any Other OP Chain/Fork that joins the Superchain. For the above reasons and others, we do not, and cannot, do so. Moreover, because the OP Stack enables anyone to create an Other OP Chain/Fork without needing the involvement of the Foundation, the existence of an Other OP Chain/Fork does not indicate, imply, or require any involvement or responsibility of the Foundation.</li><li><b>OP Mainnet and the OP Stack are works in progress.</b> They are built on new and evolving technology. Their codebase has been audited, but it still may contain unknown bugs. In addition, the security of OP Mainnet is currently dependent on a multisignature wallet, managed by the participants of the Optimism governance-approved Security Council, which can be used to maliciously upgrade core OP Mainnet smart contracts without upgrade delays or the approval of the Optimism Collective. This introduces various risks, including the loss of some or all of the assets held within the system.</li><li><b>Do your own research before using or engaging with OP Mainnet or any Other OP Chain/Fork.</b> <!-- -->Be careful and always do your own due diligence before engaging with any component of OP Mainnet or any Other OP Chain/Fork, regardless of who built or implemented it. Read widely. Stay on top of updates and developments. Be curious. Don’t leave any stone unturned, and don’t assume that something is correct or will function a certain way without independently verifying.</li><li><b>When you use OP Mainnet, any Other OP Chain/Fork, the OP Stack, or any of our other Software, Content, and Activities, it is at your own risk.</b> <!-- -->This includes risks specific to them and the risks inherent in using any cryptographic or blockchain-based system (such as wallet and private key management, variable transaction costs and speeds, technological vulnerabilities, cryptographic attack vectors, and risks relating to digital assets). You should not use any of these unless you have sufficient knowledge to understand, accept, and manage all the risks.</li><li><b>… this includes the risk of loss of your wallet private keys and seed phrases.</b> <!-- -->You are solely responsible for securing the wallet private keys and seed phrases you use to store and transfer assets on OP Mainnet and any Other OP Chain/Fork. It is your responsibility to avoid losing them or sharing them with anyone else. Once lost, there may be nothing that can be done to recover access to your wallet or to otherwise provide you with recourse.</li><li><b>We may (but will not be obligated to) take or authorize certain actions to attempt to mitigate critical security vulnerabilities and protect the community.</b> <!-- -->Although your use of any OP Chain is entirely at your own risk, we may in certain instances take (or authorize others to take) steps to protect the community (“Mitigation Efforts”), although we will not have any obligation to do so. If a critical security vulnerability is discovered, pausing the protocol (“Pausing” or a “Pause”) may be a potentially effective way to mitigate immediate harms. Because of the need to act quickly in such situations, Pausing (but not unpausing) may be pre-signed, meaning it may not be subject to the normal procedures of OP Mainnet or the Other OP Chain/Fork. For the same reason, the unilateral ability to Pause may be delegated to trusted third parties. Pausing may temporarily interfere with your ability to access your assets or otherwise use or interact with OP Mainnet or an Other OP Chain/Fork, and may have other longer-term effects on OP Mainnet or the Other OP Chain/Fork, and your assets, including an effect on value. You acknowledge and agree that Pausing is a reasonable way (among others) to attempt to mitigate security vulnerabilities but that Pauses or other Mitigation Efforts may or may not be implemented and may not successfully mitigate security vulnerabilities if they are implemented, and that the risks associated with Pausing and other Mitigation Efforts are among the risks you assume when you use OP Mainnet or an Other OP Chain/Fork and are covered by the waiver and disclaimer of liability in Section 3, below.</li><li><b>We are not, do not speak for, and cannot bind, the Optimism Collective.</b> <!-- -->The Optimism Collective is a collection of independent contributors to the Optimism project. The Foundation is a separate, independent entity. While we currently do work to steward the Optimism Collective and its mission, we do not speak for the Optimism Collective, and cannot contractually bind it in any manner. Unless we say otherwise in writing, the individual conduct of participants in the Optimism Collective are not covered, or endorsed by, the Foundation in any way.<!-- --> </li><li><b>We do not endorse third parties or third-party information.</b> <!-- -->Any time we link to, quote or otherwise reference a third party or reproduce or incorporate their information, content or material, it is solely for informational purposes. You should not assume that we have verified the accuracy of, or endorse in any way, such information, content, or materials. We may have a financial interest in some of the third-parties or projects we link to, reference, or promote.</li><li><b>You are responsible for your own compliance.</b> We attempt to comply with applicable laws, rules, and contractual obligations with respect to all of our Software, Content, and Activities. However, that landscape is constantly changing and differs jurisdiction by jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to conduct your own inquiry to ensure that your activity on OP Mainnet and any Other OP Chain/Fork complies with all applicable laws, rules, and contractual obligations.</li><li><b>When we talk about future ideas or prospects, we are expressing our vision and hopes, and there is no commitment or guarantee that it will come true, that we will implement any of it, or that it will work.</b> <!-- -->The world changes quickly and technology at an even faster pace. We have no idea how things will turn out and our aspirations and predictions may be unreliable. Look carefully at the date of things because after that date, things might have changed (a lot).</li><li><b>You should not rely on us for any specific future work.</b> The Foundation aims to make technical and governance contributions that allow the Foundation to further and progressively decentralize its role over time. We happily contribute to the Optimism community today, but we are also proud to pursue a world where this community does not need us in order for it to continue to thrive tomorrow. That’s the whole point of a public, open source, blockchain-based system governed by a decentralized Collective.</li></ul><p>While the above is not an exhaustive list of potentially relevant considerations, we hope you find it, and the other content of this Agreement, helpful.
